Milestone 1:
	Basic menus and enough SDL stuff to draw them:
		- Menu porting: TLZ
		- SDL crap: Glitch (blitting, timing, keyboard input, ?)
		- Resource loading: MXD
		- Text writing: Glitch and/or MXD


Milestone 2:
	Sound and music:
		More resource loading?: MXD again?
		LDS -> 10-channel MOD conversion: Glitch
		MOD playing: Glitch
		Sound effects: Glitch
		Jukebox / sound test (maybe)
	1p Arcade:
		Misc. gameloop stuff: TLZ
		Clarify this later!

Now playable?
