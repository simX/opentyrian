============================= OpenTyrian  Enhanced =============================
================================================================================

OpenTyrian is an open-source port of the DOS game Tyrian.

Tyrian is an arcade-style vertical scrolling shooter.  The story is set
in 20,031 where you play as Trent Hawkins, a skilled fighter-pilot employed
to fight MicroSol and save the galaxy.

Tyrian features a story mode, one- and two-player arcade modes, and networked
multiplayer.

==== Additional Necessary Files ================================================
To build from source:
- A recent version of SDL
- Boost v1.35+

To play:
- Tyrian 2.1 data files which have been released for free:
    http://camanis.net/tyrian/tyrian21.zip
- A SDL runtime
    (SDL.dll on windows, other OSes should have this in the system already)

==== Keyboard Controls =========================================================
ctrl-backspace -- kill OpenTyrian
alt-enter      -- fullscreen
ctrl-f10       -- ungrab mouse

==== Default keybinding ========================================================
mouse          -- ship movement
LMB            -- fire weapons
enter or MMB   -- toggle rear weapon mode
RMB            -- fire left/right sidekick

==== Using the Console =========================================================
At any time during the game or in the menus, press Ctrl-Insert, and then the
tilde (~`) key to bring down the console.  To dismiss is, press tilde again and
then Ctrl-Delete.  Ctrl-Insert and Ctrl-Delete are needed because of a code
limitation and their need will be removed in a future version.

NOTE: If you use the console in certain game screens (like the main menu), you
      will experience color glitches. This is a limitation of OpenTyrian's video
      mode and can't be easily fixed. Since it works correctly in-game and in
      most menus just switch to another menu temporarily if you want to work
      with the console.

With the console open, PageUp and PageDown will allow you to view the scrollback
buffer, minus (-_) and plus (=+) key will resize the console.  Home, End,
Delete, Backspace and the left and right arrow keys are available for line
editing.

Using the Console, you can invoke CCmds. To list all the available ccmds, use
the "list" ccmd with a single "ccmd" parameter: `list ccmd`. The `set` ccmd
deserver special attention: With it you can set CVars, which are settings used
for game configuration, cheats, among other things.  Like with ccmds, you can
list cvars using `list cvar`.  You can search ccmds and cvars containing a
certain sub-string by giving "list" any other parameter.  Some examples of
commands:

 Command                 | Result
-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------
 list snd_               | Lists all ccmds and cvar containing "snd_" in their
                         | name.
 echo "Hello World!"     | Prints "Hello World!" (without the quotes) to the
                         | console. Useful for scripts.
 help snd_sfx_volume     | Displays help text for cvar "snd_sfx_volume".
 set snd_sfx_volume 0.75 | Sets the value of snd_sfx_volume to 0.75.
 exec script.con         | Executes the contents of file "script.con" as if
                         | they were typed into the console.

Files in the "autorun" directory will automatically be executed at startup by
the game, so you can put your configuration settings there.

==== Commandline Parameters ====================================================
Legacy Tyrian commandline options aren't supported anymore.  Most options have
been moved to CVars:

 Old Commandline | New CVar
-----------------+-----------------------
 CONSTANT        | ch_constant_play
 DEATH           | ch_constant_death
 JOYMAX          | input_joy_sensitivity
 LOOT            | ch_loot
 NOJOY           | input_joy_enabled
 NOROBERT        | <Removed>
 NOSOUND         | snd_enabled
 NOXMAS          | ch_xmas
 RECORD          | record_demo
 WEAKJOY         | input_joy_filter
 YESXMAS         | ch_xmas

The ones not listed here didn't do anything and were removed.

You can still use the commandline to set cvars, using the +"command" syntax.
Some examples:

 Old     | New
---------+--------------------------
 LOOT    | +"set ch_loot true"
 NOSOUND | +"set snd_enabled false"
 NOXMAS  | +"set ch_xmas false"
 YESXMAS | +"set ch_xmas true"

==== Missing Features ==========================================================
- Network has not yet been implemented in Enhanced
- ShipEdit is planned to be included in the future.  It has not yet been
  implemented because the developers keep procrastinating.
