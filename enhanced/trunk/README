============================= OpenTyrian  Enhanced =============================
================================================================================

OpenTyrian is an open-source port of the DOS game Tyrian.

Tyrian is an arcade-style vertical scrolling shooter.  The story is set
in 20,031 where you play as Trent Hawkins, a skilled fighter-pilot employed
to fight MicroSol and save the galaxy.

Tyrian features a story mode, one- and two-player arcade modes, and networked
multiplayer.

==== Additional Necessary Files ================================================
To build from source:
- A recent version of SDL
- Boost v1.35+

To play:
- Tyrian 2.1 data files which have been released for free:
    http://camanis.net/tyrian/tyrian21.zip
- A SDL runtime
    (SDL.dll on windows, other OSes should have this in the system already)

==== Keyboard Controls =========================================================
ctrl-backspace -- kill OpenTyrian
alt-enter      -- fullscreen
ctrl-f10       -- ungrab mouse

==== Default keybinding ========================================================
mouse          -- ship movement
LMB            -- fire weapons
enter or MMB   -- toggle rear weapon mode
RMB            -- fire left/right sidekick

==== Using the Console =========================================================
At any time during the game or in the menus, press Ctrl-Insert, and then the
tilde (~`) key to bring down the console.  To dismiss is, press tilde again and
then Ctrl-Delete.  Ctrl-Insert and Ctrl-Delete are needed because of a code
limitation and their need will be removed in a future version.

NOTE: If you use the console in certain game screens (like the main menu), you
      will experience color glitches. This is a limitation of OpenTyrian's video
      mode and can't be easily fixed. Since it works correctly in-game and in
      most menus just switch to another menu temporarily if you want to work
      with the console.

With the console open, PageUp and PageDown will allow you to view the scrollback
buffer, minus (-_) and plus (=+) key will resize the console.  Home, End,
Delete, Backspace and the left and right arrow keys are available for line
editing.

Using the Console, you can invoke CCmds. To list all the available ccmds, use
the `list` ccmd with a single `ccmd` parameter: `list ccmd`. The `set` ccmd
deserver special attention: With it you can set CVars, which are settings used
for game configuration, cheats, among other things.  Like with ccmds, you can
list cvars using `list cvar`.  You can search ccmds and cvars containing a
certain sub-string by giving "list" any other parameter.  Some examples of
commands:

 Command                 | Result
-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------
 list snd_               | Lists all ccmds and cvar containing "snd_" in their
                         | name.
 echo "Hello World!"     | Prints "Hello World!" (without the quotes) to the
                         | console. Useful for scripts.
 help snd_sfx_volume     | Displays help text for cvar "snd_sfx_volume".
 set snd_sfx_volume 0.75 | Sets the value of snd_sfx_volume to 0.75.
 exec script.con         | Executes the contents of file "script.con" as if
                         | they were typed into the console.

==== Commandline Parameters ====================================================
Legacy Tyrian commandline options aren't supported anymore.  Most options have
been moved to CVars:

 Old Commandline | New CVar
-----------------+-----------------------
 CONSTANT        | ch_constant_play
 DEATH           | ch_constant_death
 JOYMAX          | input_joy_sensitivity
 LOOT            | ch_loot
 NOJOY           | input_joy_enabled
 NOROBERT        | <Removed>
 NOSOUND         | snd_enabled
 NOXMAS          | ch_xmas
 RECORD          | record_demo
 WEAKJOY         | input_joy_filter
 YESXMAS         | ch_xmas

The ones not listed here didn't do anything and were removed.

You can still use the commandline to set cvars, using the +"command" syntax.
Some examples:

 Old     | New
---------+--------------------------
 LOOT    | +"set ch_loot true"
 NOSOUND | +"set snd_enabled false"
 NOXMAS  | +"set ch_xmas false"
 YESXMAS | +"set ch_xmas true"

==== Game Directories ==========================================================
By default, OpenTyrian saves and stores configuration settings to the game's
directory. However, that may not be desirable in certain cases (like if
installing to a system directory). The game allows you to use your user's home
directory to store configuration files instead. To change the setting edit the
autorun/00paths.con. You may also change the paths the game looks in to find the
Tyrian datafiles in this file. 

NOTE: The user's home directory is different for each OS, and isn't supported on
      some. The 00paths.con file contains a list of supported OSes and the
	  user's directory location.

==== Configuration Files =======================================================
OpenTyrian Enhanced uses a script file system to configure the game. All files
in the "autorun" directory with a .con extension will automatically be executed
at startup by the game, so you can put your configuration settings there.
Additionally, the file 10config.con is auto-generated by the game, and contains
the archived values (more on that in a sec) of cvars and your binds.

NOTE: You can also use the `exec` ccmd to manually run a console script.

All configuration cvars, in addition to their current value, have an archived
value. This allows you to temporarily set a configuration option (snd_enabled,
for example) without saving it to your configuration file. To permanently set a
cvar you must use the `seta` command, which will set it's value and archive it.
Additionally, some configuration cvars are "auto-config", and will be always
automatically archived.

==== Missing Features ==========================================================
- Network has not yet been implemented in Enhanced
- ShipEdit is planned to be included in the future.  It has not yet been
  implemented because the developers keep procrastinating.
