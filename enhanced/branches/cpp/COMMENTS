Note to developers:

When copying comments from the Pascal source (recommended whenever they are still relevant) use the JE prefix.
When adding your own comment in a discussion please use your own prefix (consult the following table).

+--------------+--------+
|     Nick     | Prefix |
+--------------+--------+
|  MindlessXD  |  MXD   |
| syntaxglitch |  SYN   |
| TheLastZica  |  TLZ   |
|    yuriks    |  YKS   |
+--------------+--------+

Examples:

/* JE: Timer for XYZfoobar */

/* YKS: Phear my leet ASCII table skillz */

/* MXD: Should probably put bar as a foo.
 * YKS: Wouldn't it be a better ideia to use eggs instead of foo?
 * TLZ: The correct type is actually JE_random
 */
