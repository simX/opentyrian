#summary Frequently Asked Questions

= Q: What is OpenTyrian? =

A: [OpenTyrian] is rewrite of the Tyrian's Pascal and Assembly source-code in C, adapting it to use modern technologies instead of arcane DOS techniques.

Right now we plan to create two versions of the port:

  * *[OpenTyrianClassic OpenTyrian Classic]:* Currently being worked on, will try to faithfully recreate Tyrian, both in game and source code behaviour, won't receive any new features apart from those considered very important.
  * *[OpenTyrian]:* Starting out of the Classic port, will feature cleaned up code, and brand new features, bug fixes and customization.

= Q: Can I use Dan's released graphics with the port? =

A: No, you need to (currently) have the [Tyrian] 2.X datafiles. We plan to support [Tyrian2000 Tyrian 2000] datafiles in the future.

= Q: How do I get a copy of the source? =

A: From our Subversion repository. Follow the instruction on our home page.

= Q: Do you have an IRC channel? =

A: It's not official, but pretty much all development discussion happens on #tyrian at [http://freenode.net/ Freenode]. If you have any offers for help, or suggestions to the port, the preferred way to contact us is via IRC.
