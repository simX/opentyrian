OpenTyrian Classic
========================================

OpenTyrian is an open-source port of the DOS game Tyrian.

Tyrian is an arcade-style vertical scrolling shooter.  The story is set
in 20,031 where you play as Trent Hawkins, a skilled fighter-pilot employed
to fight MicroSol and save the galaxy.

Tyrian features a story mode, one- and two-player arcade modes, and networked
multiplayer.

== Additional Necessary Files ==========
Tyrian 2.1 data files which have been released for free
http://camanis.net/tyrian/tyrian21.zip

== Keyboard Controls ===================
ctrl-backspace -- kill OpenTyrian
alt-enter      -- fullscreen
ctrl-f10       -- ungrab mouse

arrow keys     -- ship movement
space          -- fire weapons
enter          -- toggle rear weapon mode
ctrl/alt       -- fire left/right sidekick

== Network Multiplayer =================
Currently OpenTyrian does not have an arena; as such, networked games must be
initiated manually via the command line simultaniously by both players.

syntax: tyrian --net host playernumber playername

where host is the IP address of your opponent, playernumber is either 1 or 2
depending on which ship you intend to pilot, and playername is your alias

== Missing Features ====================
ShipEdit is planned to be included in the future.  It has not yet been
implemented because the developers keep procrastinating.
